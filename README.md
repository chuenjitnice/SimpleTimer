# SimpleTimer

The simple timer count down with the loop of the set of life time management

This program created because of my lack time tracking when I work with my job and do not take a break for just a minute. So that make me feel like I ruin my work life balance so much.
Then I need to find some tool to tell me that I should take a break and come back to work later with the bright brain after relax for a bit.

After I tried to find the simple timer that I can set time just (work and break group) and repeat themself for the whole day. I can not find the tool that fit my need.

Finally, I did it myself.
I think this program can improve more than this but now I need to use it as a makeshift until I have the time to fix it. haha
